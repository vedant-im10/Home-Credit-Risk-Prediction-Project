# Home-Credit-Risk-Prediction-Project
A machine learning project focused on predicting loan default risks using advanced algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost. It involves data wrangling, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using Gini scores. This project was part of a Kaggle competition aiming to build accurate credit risk models.
